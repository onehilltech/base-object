 * descriptor class is to define a ES6 property via Object.defineProperty() on the
 * target BaseObject. This can be defined on the object prototype, or an instance of
 * the prototype.
 *
 * Subclasses can override the behavior of defineProperty() to provide a customized
 * behavior for how to define a property on the target object.
